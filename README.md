# women-in-open-source

# the problem (& the solution)

You've probably heard the statistics about women being underrepresented in technology. Numbers like "25%" or "28%" get thrown around when asked about gender breakdowns in tech companies and Computer science education programs. Unfortunately, the percentage of contributions from women in open source is oftentimes even lower than that. 

The good news is..  we can change that! Every contribution by a woman or non-binary coder onto Github will increase the number of contributions. So all women and nonbinary people have the power to increase those numbers by simply writing more code <3. 

Now, that's easier said than done. Especially if you've never contributed to an open source project before, or if you are new to Github or coding. This repo will help you create an open source contribution in less than ten minutes. Ready?

# set up 
Before you begin you should have the following:
1. A github account and git set up on your computer
2. An understanding of open source
3. A willingness to contribute to all types of projects! 

You do *not* need any coding experience! 

# let's do it

1. Fork this repo and clone it onto your computer
In the top right of the page, there is a button that says "Fork." This will copy the repository onto your github profile. Don't worry if you don't know what this language means! You can follow the full instructions here (complete with photos)
https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo. 

2. Create a new branch
On your terminal, navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo. You can create a branch by typing "git checkout -b babys-first-branch"

(babys-first-branch is the example name, you can name it whatever you want, like madis-branch or something)

3. Open the file "Fun-stuff.md".

4. Copy the example text at the top, and paste it below all of the other text on the page. 

5. Edit it with your own information, or with fake information. Save the file!!

6. Type "git status" on the command line, and you will see that "Fun-stuff.md" has been modified. *This is the code change you are going to make*

7. Type "git add Fun-stuff.md" on the command line.

8. Type "git commit -m "**your comment here**"" 

Now you can push your changes!

Type "git push origin babys-first-branch"

9. Navigate to https://github.com/lilxdata/women-in-open-source. You should see a yellow text block that says "Your recently pushed branches". Click the green button that says "Compare and Pull Request"

10. You can add comments or a different commit message here if you want. Otherwise, click "Create pull request" 

Now you've made your first pull request! It will be in "open" state until I approve and merge it. 

# next steps
That's cool but... how do I make my second pull request?

This repo was to get you comfortable with forking, pull requests, and contributing to a stranger's repo. Now that you've done it once, you have an idea of what needs to be done for your second pull request. That one will probably involve more complex changes.

## Using github labels to find opportunities: 

Many open source projects use github labels to find developers to contribute to their projects. By knowing which labels to search, you can find projects that actively welcome contributors.
